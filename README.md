Hi Everyone,

My name is Siddarth and I hail from Bangalore, India.
My Technology journey started as a Developer Support Engineer in the Internet Explorer Team of Microsoft. Like every other individual who used to think, what is there to support a "Browser" that too its Free software and there wont be any necessity to support it.. Phew...
But...there is lots to it...


Any software that runs on a hardware should be able to be accessed via Browser. Thats when I realized the importance of this team and the product. My roles and responsibilities at Microsoft used to be to dive deeper into the Developer Issues and assisting the enterprise customers in making their applications breathe well in the browser.
Just to give a broad spectrum of issues I used to handle on a daily basis are:
Application is slow in Internet Explorer but works faster in other browsers,Users are experiencing hang issues during their work hours,Some group policies are restricting the users to load their web applications,DNS is not working, DHCP is incorrectly configured,Application crashes in the browser,Certificate errors while trying to connect to a company sharepoint site
And the list goes on...


Key Learnings : Understood the way Applications are developed keeping mind the Browser Compatability which is the first access point to any service ( end user / api's etc )
Learnt the art of reverse engineering a problem with the help of powerful tools like wireshark, network monitor,fiddler,process monitor,socket tracer,windbg, analyzing core dumps and revieing the stack trace to accurately identify the function call that caused the failure etc.
Here is a link to one of the sessions I had delivered to Bangalore DotNet Developer Community:

In pursuit of my hunger to learn more about Virtualization Technologies, I had transitioned to Citrix R&D India Pvt Ltd. As a Technical Lead, I was going through the Infrastructure Design and supporting the Engineers in debugging the issues related to Citrix Virtualization Suite of Products. ( Application as a Service, Desktop as Service and Infrastrucre as a service ).

This is where my real backend journey started. Citrix Xen products provides us with a wide range of solutions right from Hypervisor ( Xen Baremetal ) , Xenapp and XenDesktop, Netscaler Loadbalancer and Sharefile services. I had built my skillset as a Virtualization expert and was writing automation scripts to parse logs, analyze the patterns in the backend logs and boost the technical troubleshooting practises.


While I was sailing the Virtualization Boat, I got an opportunity to go deeper into the BackEnd Engineering side on the worlds largest CDN provider "Akamai". I joined the Cloud Edge Engineering team and took charge to build release plans, developed and deployed product fixes and enhacements in a phased rollou with risk assessments and SDLC process, additionally got my handson with creating docker images, building jenkins pipelines and ensuring the devops practises are followed. Wrote SQL queries to build Grafana dashboards to monitor the usefulness of a feature. As a Senior Software Engineer 2, my journey was more towards design, development and working on the enhancements to the product and handling Escalations.

Constant upskilling and customer first mindset has been one thing I have carried throughout. Looking forward to learn and share more in the future.
